Naive Bayes and Random Forest, two well-known machine learning algorithms, are used to categorize reviews as authentic or fraudulent. The efficacy of these algorithms in detecting bogus reviews is evaluated through training and testing.

•	Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that works well for text classification tasks and can handle high-dimensional data, based on the Bayes theorem.

•	Random Forest: An ensemble learning technique that reduces overfitting and increases classification accuracy by building several decision trees and combining them.
